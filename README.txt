This assignment is designed to implement a class, named Menu, that models a menu of options that is
typically used in menu-driven text-based interactive programs, where the user is first presented with
a list of options to choose from and is then prompted to enter a value corresponding to an option,
very similar to menu-based voice interfaces.
